    <p><small>Recipe Author: Monti – Budget Bytes</small></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 double pie crust</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar </li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp flour </li>
        <li>1 pinch nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>6 cups sliced apples (6-8 apples) </li>
        <li>1 large egg, white and yolk separated</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a rack in the center of your oven, and top it with a pizza stone*. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Roll out
            your bottom and top pie crusts to 1/4 inch thickness. Refrigerate the top crust.</li>
        <li>Line your pie pan with the rolled out bottom crust. Beat the egg white and brush the bottom crust lightly
            with it. Use a fork to puncture the bottom crust 9 to 10 times. Refrigerate the crust-lined pie pan.</li>
        <li>Slice the 6 to 8 apples into 1/4 inch thick slices until you have 6 cups. Then place them in a colander and
            dress them with the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Place the colander in a large sauce pan. Mix the sugar, cinnamon, salt, flour, and nutmeg. Sprinkle the
            apples with the sugar mixture and incorporate thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Allow the apples to marinate in the sugar and spices for a half hour. They will release their juices into
            the sauce pan.</li>
        <li>After the apples have released their juices, remove the colander and the apples and place the pan with the
            juices over medium heat. Cook down the apple juices until a caramel forms.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced apples to the pan and cook with the caramel until slightly softened, about five minutes. Let
            them cool for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the the apples have cooled, remove the pie pan and the top crust from the refrigerator. Add the apple
            slices to the crust-lined pie pan.</li>
        <li>Cover the apples with the top crust. Fold the top crust under the edges of the bottom crust and pinch the
            crusts together. Flute the crusts. Beat the egg yolk and the cream together and brush the top crust with the
            egg wash.</li>
        <li>Slice steam vents into the top crust. Place the pie pan on top of your pizza stone and bake for 45 minutes,
            or until the top crust is golden brown and the pie's juices are bubbling.</li>
        <li>Cool the apple pie for at least 30 minutes before slicing, but preferably for an hour to allow the filling
            to solidify.</li>
    </ol>
